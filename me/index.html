        Hello friends!
        </div>
        <div class="el3">
          My name is Svetlana.  I am 43 years old.  And I am fond of knitting on a machine. 
        </div>

          Knitting from yarn is an ancient<br>
          craft, started in the 11th century. <br>
          At first, they knitted only with<br>
          knitting needles and crochet.<br>
          Later, knitting machines were<br>
          invented, which improved over time.<br>
          The development reached all the way <br>
          to industrial knitting machines.<br>
          On which large volumes of the same <br>
          things are knitted.
        </div>
        <div class="el6">
          My hobby is a home knitting machine, thanks to which you <br>
          can create individual things with different designs.
        </div>
        <div><img src="/img/photo_2024-09-14_23-20-06.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="350px" class="el7"></div>

        <div class="el9">
          Another hobby of mine is natural high-quality yarn.  <br>
          Cashmere, merino, yak, angora, mohair, alpaca, and various mixtures thereof.<br>
          High-quality yarn is very soft and gentle, envelops the body with gentle warmth.  <br>
          Yes, quality yarn is not cheap.  It is worth it.  But it's worth it.  <br>
          Because a sweater made of high-quality natural yarn, with proper care, <br>
          will last you more than one season.

        <div class="el11">Imagine that you can order a sweater in your favorite color, <br>
             in your favorite design, and in your size.<br>
             Also, according to your wishes, your initials can be embroidered on the sweater.<br>
             A sweater can be colored, monochromatic, striped like a rainbow🙂🙃, <br>
             with flowers, polka dots, squares, a sweater with your favorite animal, <br>
             and many other things.  Fantasy on a home knitting machine can be unlimited.<br>  
             Although sometimes there are models that are difficult to repeat on a <br>
             machine, they must be made only with knitting needles by hand.</div>

              Therefore.  I invite you to my shop.  Into the world of knitted things.<br>
              Perhaps you will pick up <br> 
              something from the <br> 
              assortment.  And maybe you <br>
              will be interested in knitting <br> 
              an individual item: a sweater, a dress,<br> 
              a capor, a scarf, a balaclava.

              I really want to share my passion with you.  I want you to feel <br>
              the gentle touch of a real cashmere sweater.  Its softness and <br>
              beauty.  Also, so that you can feel the versatility of a merino <br>
              sweater or dress.  Things made of natural yarn are in no way <br>
              comparable to rubber sweaters from the mass market.

              Allow yourself better.  Because you are worth it. Sincerely, Svetlana.
